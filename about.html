    <p id="about_info"><br><br>The Phantasy is a subconscious state of mind, which is created from the depths of one's imagination, becoming indistinguishable from reality. The concept is similar to that of an infant during early developmental years where the child has no rational way to determine reality from fantasy, but functions in a place where the lucid and the dream coexist as one state of mind allowing for the mind to indulge in irrational pleasures. Phantsies are the instinctual emotions that represent the subconscious drive to satisfy the deepest of urges and fetishes. According to Melanie Klein, the phantasies created during a time of unconscious thought leave imprints on the mind that remain active, causing a powerful influence on the drives and emotions of the individual later in life. These phantasies can commonly create feelings of guilt or insecurity as they are formed from a state of mind that lacked rational thought.<br><br>
While the common adult chooses to store the phantasies within their subconscious, some feel the urge to express them but are quickly restricted by the perversion that may be associated; many times impeding the release of sexual frustration or a true form of self expression, causing an increase of sexual insecurities that are derived from societal pressures. In searching for sanctuary, I have found that there was never a need to escape from the phantasy, but a time needed to embrace and understand that my insecurities were nothing more than characteristics that make up the relationships I have now. It was the act of maturation connected with the surge of confidence that allowed for the phantasies to leave the realm of the subconscious and become a norm in my reality.<br><br>
My work represents the struggle of losing one's self to the pressures of purity while confronting my demands that deny me the freedom to connect my phantasy with fantasy. In relation to the prodigal daughter, I found myself fleeing to a world thought to be desired, but returning to a place where I discovered there was never a reason to leave. I continually ask myself not where did I go or why did I return, but why was there such a drastic urge to hide?<br><br>
